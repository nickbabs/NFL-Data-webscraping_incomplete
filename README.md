# NFL-Data-webscraping_work-in-progress
In this file I attempt to create a dataset by scaping data from the website https://www.nfl.com/stats/team-stats/offense/passing/2021/reg/all.
Data was successfully scraped from the web and imported into a dataset. Three datasets consisting of team defensive and offenseive statistics were created.


This work was started for a class project in my graduate program before deciding to change topics, so it is still an ongoing project.
